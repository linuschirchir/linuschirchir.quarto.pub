Landing in Swansea, Wales, UK, in late December 2021 from Eldoret, Kenya marked the beginning of a transformative journey during one of the most challenging times in recent history. The world was grappling with the peak of the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, and the outbreak of a new variant, Omicron, was a stark reminder of the urgency and importance of Health Data Science (HDS). Driven by a passion for using data to solve complex health challenges, I embarked on my master’s studies in HDS.

During my studies, I explored courses such as Machine Learning (ML), Data Modelling, Data Visualisation, Bioinformatics for Genome Analysis, Analysis of Linked Health Data, and Scientific Computing in Healthcare. My dissertation “Evaluating Cognitive Assessments in the Progression to Early-Stage Alzheimer’s Disease Using Machine Learning,”...

PostgreSQL (Postgres) is an open-source enterprise relational database management system (RDBMS) that supports both relational (SQL) and non-relational (JSON) querying. The Postgres project began at the University of California in 1986 and has been growing by leaps and bounds. This RDBMS is highly reputed for its high levels of resilience, integrity, and correctness. Many products and solutions have been developed based on PostgreSQL.

To get started, you may need to download and install PostgreSQL for your operating systems such as Linux, macOS and Windows from the link below. Follow on-screen instructions and leave all the default settings in place. The official PostgreSQL website provides a step by step guide on how to install PostgreSQL here. Download and install PostgreSQL for your operating system from the link below.

R on the other hand is a free programming language used for predictive analytics, statistical modelling, data visualization and machine learning. The language was developed by Robert Gentleman and Ross Ihaka of the University of...
